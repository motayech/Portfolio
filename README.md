# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. Here, you will find the projects that I have carried out in my journey to becoming a data analyst. To be included in this portfolio are: machine learning projects (using Python), data visualization projects (using Tableau & PowerBI). statistics and forecasting projects (using R), and applications (built using Streamlit).
